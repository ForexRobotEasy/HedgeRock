## HedgeRock Trading Robot

This code represents a trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The robot is designed to execute hedging strategies in the foreign exchange market. It utilizes the MetaTrader platform and requires the Trade.mqh library.

### Functionality

The trading robot follows the following logic:

1. Initialize the trade object and define necessary constants such as maximum lots to trade, stop loss, take profit, and martingale step size.
2. OpenHedgePosition(): Open a hedge position by calculating the hedge price and lots based on the entry price and current market price. Place a sell stop order.
3. MoneyManagement(): Adjust the lot size based on the current account balance. The lot size is increased for higher account balances.
4. Martingale(): Implement a martingale feature by increasing the lot size for subsequent hedge trades.
5. ShouldCloseHedgePosition(): Check if the hedge position should be closed based on the current profit. If the profit reaches the take profit or stop loss levels, the position is closed.
6. CloseHedgePosition(): Close all open hedge trades and reset trade parameters.
7. OnTick(): The main function that is executed on each tick. It checks if a hedge position is open and whether it should be closed or a new position should be opened.
8. OnInit(): Initialize the trading robot by setting initial trade parameters, stop loss, take profit levels, and enabling automatic money management.
